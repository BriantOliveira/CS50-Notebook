This repository is for my personal notes during my online course on Edx.

Course intro - 

Hello, world! This is CS50 \(aka CS50x through edX\), Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

You are welcome to take CS50 at your own pace, starting whenever you'd like. So no worries if this is your first time here! The course's materials will be updated on 1 January 2018, but any scores you receive in 2017 will be carried over into 2018.
