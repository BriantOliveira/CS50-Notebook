Selection Sort - is an algorithm that, as you might expect, sorts a set of elements. And algorithm recall is a step-by-step set of instructions for completing a task. In the selection sort that basic idea is this, find the smallest unsorted element and add it to the end of the sorted list. 

Bubble Sort - The idea behind that one is to swap adjacent pairs. So that's the key that helps you remember the difference here. 



Insertion sort - The idea behind this algorithm is to build you sort array in place, shifting elements out os the way as you go, to make room. 



Linear search - Is an algorithm we can use to find an element in an array.In pseudocode, which is a more distilled version of this sentence, if the first element is what you're looking for, you can stop. Otherwise, move to the next element and going over and over until you find the element, or to the next. 



Binary search - Unlike linear search, it requires a special condition be met beforehand, but it's so much more efficient if that condition is, in fact, met. So what's the idea here? It's divide and conquer. We want to reduce the size of the search are by half each time in order to find a target number. We can only leverage the power of eliminating half of the elements without ever looking at them if the array is sorted. 



Recursion - The way recursion works is, a recursive function is defined as a function that calls itself as part of its execution.
